# RoxeSample
This is a sample on how to use the ROXE REST API to handle PBX objects. It also includes a tab for Phone Set Programming.

To use it you need to create a copy of your Chrome shortcut with the following target:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --args --ignore-certificate-errors --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="C:/ChromeDevSession"

Then you need to publish the application directory in a web server like nginx.
